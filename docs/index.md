# ReDI Ruby Class - Group 1

## Sun 2015-03-20 (Til)

The fundamentals of Rails - everything one needs to know to add a
resource. Following this presentation
[redi-rails](https://tils.net/redi-rails/redi-rails.html) (no source
code online). At the end there was a longer practice session, adding a
resource to a fresh new rails app (a blog with posts).

HTML and CSS practice, students mostly on their own researching and
trying to implement their own design ideas. Continued on the
hello-html-and-css-world practice project.

We started with a short recap of homework, then spent the rest of the
day with basic HTML and CSS.

We followed this presentation on
[HTML and CSS](https://tils.net/html-and-css-presentation/html-and-css.html). (On GitHub:
[presentation source code](https://github.com/til/html-and-css-presentation)).

To practice, everyone checked out this repository, which contained
empty pages and empty css files:
[hello-html-and-css-world](https://github.com/ReDI-School/hello-html-and-css-world/).
Some pushed their changes at the end, but that was not the main focus
of the session.

Key concepts covered (see presentation for all)

* basic html structure
* basic html tags
* static pages
* relative links and image references
* css selectors

Homework: further experiment with the hello-html-and-css-world files
locally, possibly add content that could be part of their projects.
